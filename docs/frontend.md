## About the project

It’s no secret that “Data is the new oil”. We all visit hundreds of websites daily and we share and create huge amounts of data every single day on those websites. Many of those websites aren’t secure in terms of user privacy and data protection. Several organizations use insecure connections to transfer data over their intranet, which is a major vulnerability. 

Our aim is to secure the transfer of data over insecure channels. We will be encrypting all the outgoing requests from the frontend and all the outgoing requests from the bakcend and thus ensuring the security of data.

## Project Structure

Our project has the following structure:
  * public
  * src
    * Components
    * Contexts

  ### 1. Public
  It contains the index.html file and other metadata for the single page react app.

  ### 2. src
  The entire source code for the UI is present in this folder.

  ### 4. Components
  This contains all the files for the resuable UI components.

  ### 5. Contexts
  This contains all the contexts which are needed for maintaining the states of the app at higher level components.
